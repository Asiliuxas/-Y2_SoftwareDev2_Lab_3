1. Count the number of words in the text file (using java)

2. Using previously developed methods count the number of vowels in the file and the average number of vowels per word

3. Print out the words in the file so that words longer than 3 chars will have the first and last letter stay the same but the middle letters jumbled for example **please jumble these letters** becomes **pealse jmulbe tehse ltetres**
